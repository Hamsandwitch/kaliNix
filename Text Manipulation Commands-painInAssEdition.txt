Text Manipulation Commands - Pain in my ass wordlists edition



awk '!x[$0]++' file > file.new

^ takes input file and removes any duplicate lines from the file. Does not reorganize, and the do not have to be successive lines (i.e. no sort/uniq BS)



## this will combine files 1,2,and 3 into the big file. 

bt~# cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > bigfile.txt


##For when you want to add or update your old dictionary, simply double the arrow like this......

bt~# cat new_dict.txt >> name_of_old_bigfile.txt




##For speed, you can put all the files in a directory called wordlists. then cd into the directory and

bt~# cat *.* > /root/bigfile.txt

##This will merge all the files in the current directory into 1 .txt wordlist




This will alphabetize the list and remove the duplicates.

bt~# cat bigfile.txt | sort | uniq  > newbigfile.txt




##This will make your list WPA/WPA2 compatiable by deleting words less than 8 chars and more than 63

bt~# cat passwordlist.txt | pw-inspector -m 8 -M 63 > wpaList.txt
